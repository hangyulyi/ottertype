# ottertype

This is a remake of the popular `monkeytype.com` typing test.

This project is still in the works and isn't complete yet!

## TODO:
- Create cursor follow for user input
- Fix TypingArea so user can click in to begin typing
- Implement generating TextDisplay from a file (random words picked and is infinite)
- Create a time over page to display final WPM
